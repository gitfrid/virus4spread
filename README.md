**virus4spread virus distribution model-simulation**

**This project is holded, after I was pointed out to following:**

None of those three imaginary states (Latency, Infectious, Immunity) describe in any manner any real physical/biological system. 
<br>
Contagions doesn't work that way (like petri dishes reductionism). 
<br>
<br>
For the most part viruses are already ubiquitous at very low prevalence.
<br>
All viruses are beneficial at different levels of expression/prevalence. Same as bacteria. 
<br>Only when the dynamical system loses its capacity for information transfer, pathogenic viruses proliferate causing harm.
<br>They are important components of the ecosystem that have a necessary biological function, 
such as building networks for the transmission of information in this system.
<br>
<br>

**Here arises an attempt to test DR Clare Craig's hypothesis about airborne virus contagion -> Book Expired**.
<br> 
To investigate annually recurring waves from the momentum of a chaotic system, and study or play with it's dynamics.
<br> 
Since the linear sientific SIR model used, seems to differ from reality.
<br>
<br>So what is special about this simulation? 
<br>Most other simulations already assume the droplet theory, this one does not. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
The recurring waves can possibly be explained by the properties of the coupled system.
<br>Without having to resort to changes to the environment or immune system.

**Installation:**
<br>
<br>**Prerequisite: Microsoft .Net 8 has to be installed first!** https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download
<br>
<br>The binary files (about 2 MB) can be compiled with the free Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 Edition. 
<br>Just download Visual Studio , download virus4spread source, open the Project and click the Bulid Menu.
<br>
<br>No Setup needed - it is  sufficient if the binary files are copied fom the compiled folder 
<br>../Virus4spread/bin/Release/net8.0-windows to any folder, then double click Virus4spread.exe to run the Simulation.
