**virus4spread virus distribution model-simulation**

**Here arises an attempt to test DR Clare Craig's hypothesis about airborne virus contagion -> Book Expired**.
<br> 
To investigate annually recurring waves from the momentum of a chaotic system, and study or play with it's dynamics.
<br> 
Since the linear sientific SIR model used, seems to differ from reality.
<br>
<br> 
<br>So what is special about this simulation?
<br>Most other simulations already assume the droplet theory, this one does not. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
 **Forked from virus3spread with simple virus propagation and immune system, better code readability, dependencies removed, lightweight rendering using FastBitmap **
<br>Further information see [virus4spread wiki](https://github.com/gitfrid/virus4spread/wiki)
<br>
<br> 
The recurring waves can possibly be explained by the properties of the coupled system.
<br>Without having to resort to magical changes in the environment or the immune system.

<br>
**Installation:**
<br>
<br>**Prerequisite: Microsoft .Net 8 has to be installed first!** https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download
<br>
<br>The binary files (about 2 MB) can be compiled with the free Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 Edition. 
<br>Just download Visual Studio , open the Project and click the Bulid Menu.
<br>
<br>No Setup needed - it is  sufficient if the binary files are copied fom the compiled folder - : 
<br>/Virus3spread/bin/Release/net8.0-windows7.0/*.*  to any folder, then double click Virus4spread.exe to run the Simulation.

Just a simulation model, for use out of pure curiosity, not to force people.
