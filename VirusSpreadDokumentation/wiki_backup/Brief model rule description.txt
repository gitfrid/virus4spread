## Brief model rule description

At the beginning, a fixed number of viruses and people are randomly distributed on a rectangular grid field.

Viruses and persons can move randomly on the rectangular grid in a defined square area.

Several people or viruses can be located on one coordinate of the grid field.

If one or more persons meet one or more viruses on a grid coordinate, 
then these persons get infected.

A person goes through three periods.
Latency, infection and immunity

In the infectious period, a person can reproduce a defined fixed number of viruses at each iteration.

A virus has a certain lifespan, after which it decays and is deleted.
