## Detaild rules of the Model
<br>**A detailed description of each parameter can be found at the bottom of the program window**
<br>**It can be enlarged so that the entire text is displayed.**
<br>

## **General:**
<br>
<br>There are persons and viruses as a generic term called creatures.<br>
<br>The initial population of people is fixed and cannot change.<br>
<br>The initial population of viruses is also fixed, but can change over time/iterations.<br>
<br>There is a two-dimensional rectangular grid with integer x, y coordinated<br>
<br>Days/iterations represent the flow of time at different integer points in time 1-n<br>
<br>A creature can be located at exactly one x,y coordinate at any one time.<br>
<br>A creature has exactly one initial randomly chosen home coordinate on the grid.<br>
<br>There can be any number of creatures on any grid coordinate x,y.<br>
<br>

## **Movement:**
<br>Creatures can move randomly on the grid in any direction within a given circle area.<br>
<br>Creatures can move globally or locally, i.e. not globally.<br>
<br>Creatures move globally by using the end point of the last movement, i.e. the current coordinate position, 
<br>as the new center point for the circular area for their next movement.<br>
<br>When creatures move locally, they use their home coordinate as the center point for the circular area,
<br>they can then only move within this circular area.
<br>
<br>Globaly they move across the entire grid, otherwise only in a specified circular area.
<br>The radius of the circular area for the movement can vary each iteration.
<br>
<br>At each iteration, a tuple is randomly selected from the set.<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>This tuple specifies the possible circular area for the movement. 
<br>The creature then performs a random movement within this area.
<br>
<br>Creatures can move back to the home coordinate every x-th iteration if PersenMoveHomeActivityRnd is not 0.
<br>Where x is an integer. This can be used to approximate the daily occupational traffic.

## **Infection:**
<br>If one or more people on the same coordinate encounter a virus, they all become infected. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>The **latency period** is a certain number of days/iterations
<br>
<br>The **infectious period** afterwards is again a certain number of days/iterations. During this period, the person is contagious. 
<br>By each iteration, it generates a certain number of viruses at the grid coordinate where it is currently located.
<br>
<br>The **reinfection immunity periode** afterwards is again a certain number of days/iterations, during which the person cannot get reinfected.
<br>After this Period the person can get reinfected again. Then the cycle starts all over again
<br>
<br>

**Person Reinfaction Rate** in percent
<br>
<br>Indicates the percentage per iteration of the people with **reinfection immunity** status,
<br>who switch to **healthy or recovered** status, and could therefore become infected again.
<br>This means that the cycle starts again for them, by switching to the healthy or recovered status.
<br>
<br>If **Person Reinfaction Rate** is **100%**, all persons pass through the immunity status,
<br>and can be reinfected again, after the immunity periode.<br>
