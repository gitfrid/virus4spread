## virus4spread virus distribution model-simulation

**An attempt to  DR Clare Craig's hypothesis about airborne virus contagion -> Book Expired.**
<br>
To investigate annually recurring waves from the momentum of a chaotic system, and study or play with it's dynamics.
<br>
Since the linear sientific SIR model used, seems to differ from reality.


So what is special about this simulation?
Most other simulations already assume the droplet theory, this one does not.

**Forked from virus2spread and implemented a very simple virus reproduction and immune system.**
**With some biger Changes - see below**

**For certain parameters, a damped oscillation results solely from the internal properties of this simple model.**
<br>
Whether the model can explain the recurring waves, would have to be investigated by real measurements or experiments.
<br>
As soon as I slow down the movement of the people, the big oscillations disappear. 
<br>

**Provided that the code is free of errors?**
<br>
<br>
**Hints**
<br>It is possible to save and open the configuration as an xml file.
<br>The diagrams can be saved as a bitmap with the right mouse button.
<br>Or the plot data can be exported and saved to a CSV file.
<br>For some parameters, such as colors, the application must be closed and reopened for the change to take effect.
<br>
<br>

**CHANGES**
<br>
**Better code readability, Nuget dependencies removed, source of Nuget packages included**
<br>
<br>
Only two Nuget dependencies of Scotplot remaining:
 - System.Drawing.Common 4.7.2
 - System.Numerics.Vectors 4.5.0

Everything else is in the Source Code!
Binarys much smaller about 2 MB.  
Rendering changed from SkiaSharp Library to Fast Bitmap for less overhad.
<br>
<br>

**Performance To Doos**
<br>When using a large 3000x3000 raster field or a large number of viruses/humans, the APP no longer responds.
<br>Long loading time when initializing FastBitmap with a large grid field.<br>
